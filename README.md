# Nerves Toolchain: armv6_rpi_linux_gnueabi

This is a Nerves Toolchain repository.
If you're just trying to use Nerves (i.e. not develop support for new Target hardware), you don't need to use it directly.
You can read more about [how to use pre-built Systems in the Nerves Documentation](https://hexdocs.pm/nerves/systems.html).

Its purpose is to:
  1. provide a place to put configuration for this particular Nerves Toolchain,
  2. act as a repository for this particular pre-built Nerves Toolchain (using the GitHub Releases feature), and
  3. allow a small package to be published to Hex, so it can inject the correct Toolchain into a Nerves compilation using Mix.
