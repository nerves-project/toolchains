    crosscompiler on macOS x86_64 host.

## v1.8.0

This release bumps gcc 9.2.0 to gcc 10.2.0.

* Enhancements
  * Update crosstool-ng git commit. This pulls in gcc 10.2 support and
    a variety of C library and related version bumps.
  * Update macOS build homebrew paths to latest versions.
  * Update toolchain vendor to `nerves` in default defconfigs.

## v1.7.2

  * Update macOS homebrew paths for dependencies.

## v1.7.1

* Enhancements
  * 64-bit ARM host builds (aarch64) are now possible. They must be built on
    64-bit ARM machines. Canandian cross versions aren't supported.

## v1.7.0

This release bumps gcc 8.3.0 to gcc 9.2.0.

* Enhancements
  * Update crosstool-ng to latest git commit. This pulls in gcc 9.2 support and
    a variety of C library and related version bumps.

* Bug fixes
  * Fixed a variety of build issues on Linux, OSX, and CI. If you're building
    your own toolchains, you may want to review commits to see what has changed.

## v1.6.0

* Enhancements
  * Update crosstool-ng to crosstool-ng-1.24.0-rc3. This pulls in many updates
    including a bump from gcc 7.3.0 to gcc 8.3.0.

## v1.5.0

* Enhancements
  * Update crosstool-ng to latest to use gcc 7.3.0. This addresses a C++
    compiler issue and may bring in performance improvements.
  * Update build scripts to throw errors when configurations are out of sync
    so that if crosstool-ng drops any options, we definitely know. The checks
    are currently pretty strict (config option order matters, for example)
    since the pain from silent option drops was so great.

* Bug fixes
  * Ensure that all toolchains are static

## v0.6.1

* New features

## v0.6.0

This version removes Erlang and Elixir from the toolchain. While this was
convenient for creating repeatable builds, differences between Linux
distributions were great enough that multiple versions would need to be made
just for Linux. Aside from this, the versions made here could not easily be
used in nerves-system-br builds and most users had sufficiently compatible
versions of Erlang already. Bakeware will be responsible for matching versions
exactly and nerves-system-br will be responsible for providing errors and
warnings when host/target Erlang and Elixir versions do not match.

  * glibc 2.21
