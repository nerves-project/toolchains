## v0.6.0

This version removes Erlang and Elixir from the toolchain. While this was
convenient for creating repeatable builds, differences between Linux
distributions were great enough that multiple versions would need to be made
just for Linux. Aside from this, the versions made here could not easily be
used in nerves-system-br builds and most users had sufficiently compatible
versions of Erlang already. Bakeware will be responsible for matching versions
exactly and nerves-system-br will be responsible for providing errors and
warnings when host/target Erlang and Elixir versions do not match.
